 - This program is had copied elevator algorithm.
 - I'm add several debug information on running program like: where am I?, elevator direction, current floor etc.
 - One thing special is when you call elevator with pushing up or down button, the program show you emoji that how long you wait time for take elevator.
 - Anyway, a lot of mistake or missing coding can be had in program. plz look at me with kindness. Thank you guys.
